# React App

This is a simple React application I am building as part of my internship.  
It currently displays a message inside a styled **Card** component, supports **light/dark mode**, and now features **responsive design**.

---

## Features
- Message wrapped inside a Card container for better UI.
- Light/Dark mode toggle.
- State management using:
  - `useState` → to store and update the theme.
  - `useEffect` → to update the UI when the theme changes.
- **Responsive design** using a **mobile-first approach** with CSS media queries.
